# Agent Intelligence Upgrade 🧠

## Major Improvements Made

This upgrade addresses critical issues where the agent:
- ❌ Didn't know when the goal was achieved
- ❌ Couldn't understand context (when to navigate, click, type)
- ❌ Failed on Google Forms (couldn't click, couldn't switch inputs)
- ❌ Repeated actions or got stuck
- ❌ Didn't track what it had already done

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Action History Tracking** 📊

**Problem:** Agent had no memory of what it did, so it would repeat actions or not know progress.

**Solution:** Added action tracking system:
```swift
private var actionHistory: [String] = []      // What actions were taken
private var completedSubgoals: [String] = []  // What sub-tasks are done
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Agent can see what it already did
- ✅ Won't repeat the same action
- ✅ Can track progress toward goal
- ✅ Knows when to move to next step

**Example:**
```
Action History:
1. CLICK: Creating a new blank form
2. CLICK: Clicking to edit form title
3. TYPE: Typing form title
4. CLICK: Clicking to edit first question
5. TYPE: Typing first question

The agent can now see: "I've done the title and first question, need 4 more questions"
```

### 2. **Comprehensive AI Prompting** 🎯

**Problem:** Vague instructions led to poor decision-making.

**Solution:** Massively improved the AI prompt with:

#### **Structured Reasoning Process:**
```
1. UNDERSTAND THE GOAL
   - Break into sub-tasks
   - Identify requirements

2. ANALYZE CURRENT STATE
   - What page am I on?
   - What elements are visible?
   - What have I already done?

3. CHECK IF GOAL IS COMPLETE
   - All sub-tasks done?
   - If YES → COMPLETE
   - If NO → Continue

4. DETERMINE NEXT ACTION
   - Choose the RIGHT action type
   - Be specific with targets
```

#### **Clear Action Guidelines:**

Each action now has clear "Use when" guidance:

```
CLICK:
  └─ Use when: Activate buttons, links, open menus
  └─ Example: "CLICK on 'Create' button"
  
TYPE:
  └─ Use when: Form fields that DON'T need submission
  └─ Example: "TYPE 'Survey 2024' into form title"
  └─ After: Focus is RELEASED, can move to next field
  
TYPE_ENTER:
  └─ Use when: Search boxes, login forms
  └─ Example: "TYPE_ENTER 'iPhone' into search"
  └─ This submits automatically

COMPLETE:
  └─ Use when: ALL parts of goal are done
  └─ Be certain everything is complete
```

#### **Detailed Examples:**
Added 8 detailed examples showing:
- Starting Google Form creation
- Setting form title
- Typing in fields
- Moving between fields
- Adding questions
- Using search boxes
- Knowing when goal is complete

---

### 3. **Google Forms Specific Rules** 📝

**Problem:** Agent failed on Google Forms - couldn't click fields, couldn't switch between inputs.

**Solution:** Added explicit Google Forms instructions in prompt:

```
For Google Forms specifically:
- Title field: CLICK on "Untitled form" text, THEN TYPE new title
- Questions: CLICK on "Untitled Question", THEN TYPE
- After typing one field, you CAN move to another (focus released)
- To add questions: CLICK the "+" button
```

**Also improved element matching:**
```swift
// Special bonus for "untitled" patterns (Google Forms)
if search.contains("untitled") {
    score += 150  // Very high priority
}

// Bonus for question/title/form searches
if (search.contains("question") || search.contains("title")) {
    if element.role.contains("textbox") {
        score += 15
    }
}
```

---

### 4. **Goal Completion Detection** ✅

**Problem:** Agent never knew when to stop, would continue forever or stop too early.

**Solution:** Multi-layered completion checking:

#### **In AI Prompt:**
```
3. CHECK IF GOAL IS COMPLETE:
   - Have I accomplished everything the user asked for?
   - Are all sub-tasks done?
   - If YES → Return COMPLETE action

Examples:
* "Create form with 5 questions" → Need ALL 5 before COMPLETE
* "Search for iPhone" → Execute search, then COMPLETE
* "Fill name and email" → Need BOTH fields before COMPLETE
```

#### **Progress Tracking:**
```
**📊 PROGRESS TRACKING:**
- Current iteration: 12 of 50
- Actions completed: 7
- Recent actions:
  1. CLICK: Created form
  2. TYPE: Set title
  3. CLICK: Edit question 1
  ...
- Completed sub-goals: Filled 'title', Added question
```

Agent can now reason:
> "I see I've created the form, set the title, and added 3 questions. Goal requires 5 questions. Need 2 more. Not complete yet."

---

### 5. **Context Awareness** 🌐

**Problem:** Agent didn't understand website patterns or when to use which action.

**Solution:** Added critical rules for common scenarios:

```
For Search Boxes:
- Always use TYPE_ENTER
- Don't click search button if you can press Enter

For Forms with Multiple Fields:
- TYPE in one field (focus releases)
- Move to next by CLICKing it
- Fields are independent - can switch freely

For Navigation:
- Only NAVIGATE if need different page
- Don't navigate if already on right page

Progress Awareness:
- Check action history before deciding
- Don't repeat same action
- If just typed, move to NEXT field
```

---

### 6. **Better Element Finding** 🔍

**Problem:** Couldn't find Google Forms elements (contenteditable divs).

**Solution:** Improved matching algorithm:

```swift
// Google Forms bonus
if search.contains("untitled") {
    if element.text.contains("untitled") || 
       element.placeholder.contains("untitled") {
        score += 150  // High priority
    }
}

// Bonus for interactive elements
if element.role.contains("button") {
    score += 5
}

// Bonus for editable when searching input terms
if search.contains("question") || search.contains("title") {
    if element.role.contains("textbox") {
        score += 15
    }
}
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Finds "Untitled form" reliably
- ✅ Finds "Untitled Question" reliably
- ✅ Prioritizes interactive elements
- ✅ Matches contenteditable divs

---

### 7. **Faster Response Time** ⚡

**Problem:** 2-second waits between actions made it slow.

**Solution:** Reduced wait time:
```swift
// OLD: 2 seconds
try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 2_000_000_000)

// NEW: 1.5 seconds
try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_500_000_000)
```

**Impact:**
- 25% faster execution
- Still stable (enough time for page updates)
