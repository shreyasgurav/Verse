# Smart Website Navigation 🚀

## Overview
The agent now automatically detects which website your task requires and navigates there directly - **no more typing in Google and searching!**

## How It Works

### 1. **Intelligent Site Detection**
When you give the agent a task, it scans your goal for website mentions:
- "do this **on Amazon**"
- "search **in YouTube**"
- "create a form **on Google Forms**"
- "find products **at eBay**"

### 2. **Current Page Check**
The agent checks what page is currently open:
```
✓ Already on Amazon → Continues with task
✗ Not on Amazon → Navigates there first
```

### 3. **Direct Navigation**
Instead of:
❌ Type "amazon" in Google → Click search → Click first result

It does:
✅ Direct navigation to https://www.amazon.com

## Supported Websites
The agent recognizes these popular sites:
- **E-commerce:** Amazon, eBay
- **Social Media:** Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit
- **Google Services:** Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Forms, Drive, YouTube
- **Other:** GitHub, Netflix, Spotify, Wikipedia

## Example Usage

### Before (Old Behavior)
```
You: "Search for laptops on Amazon"
Agent: Types "amazon" → Searches → Clicks link → Then searches
```

### After (New Behavior)
```
You: "Search for laptops on Amazon"
Agent: 
  🔍 Checking current page: https://www.google.com
  📍 Required site: Amazon
  🚀 Not on Amazon, navigating directly to https://www.amazon.com
  ✅ Successfully navigated to Amazon
  [Proceeds with laptop search]
```

### If Already on the Right Site
```
You: "Search for laptops on Amazon"
Agent (already on amazon.com):
  🔍 Checking current page: https://www.amazon.com
  ✅ Already on Amazon, proceeding with task
  [Immediately starts searching]
```

## Supported Patterns
The agent recognizes various phrasings:
- "on Amazon"
- "in YouTube" 
- "at eBay"
- "from Netflix"
- "to GitHub"
- "Amazon" (at start of goal)
- "search Amazon" (at end of goal)

## Custom URLs
You can also use direct URLs:
```
"Go to https://example.com and click the contact button"
```
The agent will navigate to that exact URL first.

## No Website Specified?
If your task doesn't mention a specific website:
```
ℹ️ No specific website required, continuing on current page
```
The agent will work with whatever page is currently open.

## Benefits
1. ⚡ **Faster execution** - Skip unnecessary Google searches
2. 🎯 **More reliable** - Direct navigation prevents search result issues
3. 🧠 **Smarter workflow** - Agent understands context better
4. 💪 **Better UX** - More natural and efficient automation

## Technical Details
- Works in both `ReliableAgentService` and `EnhancedAgentService`
- Adds 3-second wait after navigation for page to fully load
- Fallback: If navigation fails, continues anyway
- Case-insensitive matching
- Regex support for URL detection

## Try It Out!
Test with these commands:
- "Search for iPhone on Amazon"
- "Find cat videos on YouTube"
- "Create a survey on Google Forms"
- "Look up artificial intelligence on Wikipedia"

The agent will automatically navigate to the right site before starting! 🎉
