# Quick Start Guide - Comet-Style Agentic Browser

## What's New

Your Arc browser now has **Comet-style agentic capabilities** with detailed chain-of-thought reasoning!

## Key Features

✅ **Detailed Reasoning**: See exactly what the agent is thinking at each step  
✅ **Reliable Interactions**: Works with all input types (text, dropdowns, contenteditable, checkboxes)  
✅ **Smart Element Selection**: Uses multiple strategies to find the right elements  
✅ **Adaptive Planning**: Continuously observes page state and adjusts strategy  
✅ **Google Forms Ready**: Specifically optimized for form creation and filling

## How to Use

### 1. Start the Browser
```bash
cd /Users/shreyasgurav/Desktop/Arc
./launch_arc.sh
```

### 2. Open a Tab & Enable Assistant
- Click the **AI icon** in the toolbar (or press a hotkey)
- The assistant sidebar opens on the right

### 3. Give it a Task

**Example Tasks:**
```
"Create a Google Form with 5 random questions on different topics"

"Go to forms.new and create a survey about favorite foods with 3 questions"

"Fill out the contact form on this page with test data"

"Navigate to Twitter and compose a tweet about AI"
```

### 4. Watch the Magic

You'll see detailed thoughts like:

```
━━━ Step 1 ━━━
👁️ Observing current page state...
📄 Current page: Google Forms
🔗 URL: https://forms.new

🧠 Analyzing what to do next...
💭 Reasoning: I can see the page has loaded with "Untitled form" 
as the form title. The goal is to create a form with 5 random 
questions. First, I need to change the form title...

🎬 Action: Setting form title to "Random Quiz Questions"
🎯 Looking for input: Untitled form
→ Found input: Untitled form
✍️ Will type: Random Quiz Questions
✓ Action completed successfully

━━━ Step 2 ━━━
...
```

## Examples

### Create a Google Form

**User Request:**
> "Create a Google Form with 5 random questions"

**What Happens:**
1. Agent navigates to forms.new (if not already there)
2. Changes form title
3. Edits first question
4. Changes question type (e.g., to dropdown)
5. Adds option values
6. Clicks "Add question"
7. Repeats for remaining questions
8. Reports completion

### Fill a Form

**User Request:**
> "Fill out this contact form with test data"

**What Happens:**
1. Agent scans form fields
2. Identifies each field type (name, email, phone, etc.)
3. Generates appropriate test data
4. Fills each field sequentially
5. Reports completion

## Tips for Best Results

### 🎯 Be Specific
❌ "Create a form"  
✅ "Create a Google Form with 3 questions about favorite movies"

### 🎯 One Task at a Time
❌ "Create a form AND send an email AND search for something"  
✅ "Create a Google Form with 5 questions" (then give next task)

### 🎯 Let It Navigate
✅ Agent will automatically go to the right URL if needed  
✅ Just describe the goal, not the steps

### 🎯 Watch the Reasoning
- The detailed thoughts help you understand what's happening
- If something goes wrong, the reasoning shows where
- You can stop anytime with the "Stop" button

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Can't Find an Element
**Cause**: Page structure is unusual or element is hidden  
**Solution**: Try more specific description: "the blue button that says 'Continue'"

### Agent Keeps Retrying
**Cause**: Page is loading slowly or element is dynamically added  
**Solution**: Let it retry a few times, or stop and try again

### Typing Not Working
**Cause**: Unusual input implementation (e.g., custom React components)  
**Solution**: The agent will try multiple strategies automatically

### Dropdown Won't Select
**Cause**: Custom dropdown implementation  
**Solution**: Agent tries multiple approaches (click to open, find option, click option)

## Stop the Agent

If you want to stop at any time:
- Click the **"Stop"** button that appears while agent is active
- Agent will gracefully stop and report status

## Architecture

```
User Request
    ↓
Intent Analysis (ChatGPT)
    ↓
Is it an ACTION or CHAT?
    ↓
[ACTION] → ReliableAgentService
    ↓
Agent Loop:
    1. Observe page (EnhancedWebScrapingService)
    2. Reason about next action (ChatGPT)
    3. Execute action (JavaScript injection)
    4. Verify result
    5. Repeat until done
```

## Files Changed

New files:
- `/Arc/Services/ReliableAgentService.swift` - Main agent service
- `/RELIABLE_AGENT_SYSTEM.md` - Technical documentation
- `/QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` - This file

Modified files:
- `/Arc/Models/TabState.swift` - Added reliableAgentService
- `/Arc/Models/BrowserViewModel.swift` - Initialize reliable agent
- `/Arc/Views/UnifiedChatSidebar.swift` - Use reliable agent

## Next Steps

Try these tasks to see the agent in action:

1. **Google Forms Creation**
   ```
   Navigate to forms.new and create a quiz about general knowledge 
   with 5 multiple choice questions
   ```

2. **Form Filling**
   ```
   Go to any contact form and fill it with test data
   ```

3. **Complex Workflow**
   ```
   Create a Google Form, add 3 questions (one multiple choice, 
   one short answer, one checkbox), and change the title to 
   "Customer Feedback Survey"
   ```

## Feedback

The agent learns and improves! If something doesn't work:
1. Check the detailed reasoning to see what went wrong
2. Try rephrasing your request more specifically
3. Make sure the page is fully loaded before giving complex tasks
